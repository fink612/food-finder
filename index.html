  <h1>Food Finder</h1>
    <p>Food Finder is a freely downloadable app that helps people with extra food find people 
    that are hungry. In recent months, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the issue 
    of food insecurity in every neighborhood. Also, people that are hungry can't always afford 
    technology or have the resources to find food giveaway events. Food Finder addresses these 
    issues by connecting people that have just a small amount of food to share at the time of cooking.</p>
